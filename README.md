# Inventory-Optimization-and-Sustainability-Analysis-Project-
I created a project on Inventory Optimization and Sustainability Analysis Project
Objectives:

Minimize waste by optimizing inventory levels.
Identify the most efficient purchasing strategies based on sales, procurement, and inventory data.
Evaluate product sales performance to develop a sustainable inventory management approach.
1. Data Preprocessing:

Combine all CSV files into a unified master dataset.
Check for any missing or incorrect entries.
Standardize date formats for consistent time series analysis.
2. Inventory Analysis:

Assess inventory status at the beginning and end of the year using BegInvFINAL12312016.csv and EndInvFINAL12312016.csv.
Identify products with the highest and lowest inventory levels.
3. Sales Analysis:

Analyze SalesFINAL12312016.csv to identify bestsellers and underperforming products.
Investigate sales trends over time, considering factors like sales quantity, sales price, and date.
4. Purchasing Analysis:

Review procurement activities using PurchasesFINAL12312016.csv and InvoicePurchases12312016.csv.
Analyze purchase volumes, procurement costs, and supply chain processes from different suppliers.
5. Optimal Stock Level Calculation:

Determine the optimal stock level for each product by analyzing sales, procurement, and inventory data.
Recommend stock levels based on product sales velocity and supply lead times.
Conclusion:

The insights from these analyses will guide recommendations for more efficient and sustainable inventory management, aiming to reduce costs and prevent overstocking and waste.
